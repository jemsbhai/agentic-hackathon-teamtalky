Agentic AI Hackathon – GitHub Setup & Submission Guide
Welcome! This template is your starting point for the Agentic AI App Hackathon. It gives you a consistent structure, built-in tools, and clear documentation to build and share your project efficiently.
To participate in the hackathon, you’ll need to create a free GitHub account and fork our hackation submission template. 
This will allow you to access the hackathon, submit your project, and collaborate with your team.
If you already have a GitHub account, you can use your existing one. If you are participating as a team, the team captain can add other team members as collaborators.

Step 1: Fork & Set Up the Repository
1. Fork the Official GitHub Template

https://github.com/odsc2015/agentic-hackathon-template

Important: Please NAME your fork exactly as your team name, this is how we track your submission. If you participate as an individual, name it as your first and last name.

Step 2: Build Your Agent
Use the src/ folder to build your Agentic AI app. Your agent should follow a common architecture including:
Core Agent Workflow:
1.	Receive user input

2.	(Optional) Retrieve relevant memory

3.	Plan sub-tasks (ReAct, BabyAGI, or other patterns)

4.	Call tools or external APIs (Gemini API)

5.	Generate final response

Core Modules to Implement: (just the concepts)
●	planner.py: break down user goals into sub-tasks

●	executor.py: logic for calling LLMs or tools

●	memory.py: log or store memory, if used

 Step 3: Use Gemini API
●	All teams MUST use the Google Gemini API in their solution.

●	Get your free API key via Google AI Studio.

●	Store your API key securely using a .env file or config pattern - do not commit your key to the repo.

●	Demonstrate Gemini’s usage clearly in your code and documentation.

Step 4: Fill in the Required Documentation
All documentation files are in the root of your repo:
●	README.md:
 Setup instructions, dependencies, and how to run your agent.

●	ARCHITECTURE.md:
 Sketch your system’s design (ASCII, PNG/JPG, or diagram). Include:

○	Planner, executor, memory structure

○	Tool integrations (Gemini, search APIs, etc.)

○	Logging and observability

●	EXPLANATION.md:
 Describe your agent’s reasoning process, memory usage, planning style, tool integration, and known limitations.

●	DEMO.md:
 Paste a public video link + timestamps:

○	00:00–00:30 - Intro & setup

○	00:30–01:30 - User input → Planning

○	01:30–02:30 - Tool calls & memory

○	02:30–03:30 - Final output & edge case handling

 Step 5: Record and Submit
●	Record a 3–5 minute video demo walking through your agent.

●	Highlight how your agent plans, retrieves memory, and uses Gemini API.

●	Upload to YouTube (unlisted), Google Drive (public), Loom, etc.

●	Paste the link in DEMO.md.
❗ Submissions without a valid, hosted public video will not be reviewed. (One person can do the video for the whole team)
 Step 6: Submit via Form (follow the deadlines listed in the form)
You’ll submit the following:
●	Your GitHub repository URL (public)

●	Your video link

●	Team name, and all the team mem (important)
The form link is here.
